## Material 3 Expressive Theme

Pockaw uses the Material 3 Expressive design system for a modern, engaging user experience. The Expressive variant of Material 3 features:

- Enhanced depth effects and shadows for visual hierarchy
- More distinctive typography with increased contrast between text roles
- Customized motion and animation for a dynamic feel
- Pure black dark mode optimized for OLED screens
- Rounded corners and consistent design language

Our implementation includes custom extensions to support Material 3 Expressive features:
- `ExpressiveExtension`: Controls depth, shadows, motion, and shape density
- `M3Colors`: Standard Material 3 color system with proper token mapping
- `M3Typography`: Expressive typography system with enhanced visual hierarchy
